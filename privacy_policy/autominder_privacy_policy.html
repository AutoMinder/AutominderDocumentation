                <p>
                  "Autominder" utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) and requires
                  access to location permissions to provide its services and
                  sync data from your vehicle. Please read the following
                  information regarding the usage of these permissions:

                    <h4>Bluetooth LE Usage</h4>

                    <p>
                      "Autominder" uses Bluetooth LE technology to establish
                      connections with your vehicle for the purpose of
                      retrieving and syncing relevant data, such as
                      identification data, diagnostic information, maintenance
                      schedules, and performance metrics. This enables the app
                      to provide accurate vehicle monitoring, reminders, and
                      notifications to enhance your user experience.

                      Access to location permissions is required by "Autominder"
                      to facilitate seamless connectivity with your vehicle. By
                      utilizing location data, the app can efficiently detect
                      and connect to your vehicle when in close proximity. It
                      should be noted that this location data is solely used for
                      establishing the connection with the vehicle and is not
                      used for any other purposes, such as tracking your precise
                      location.
